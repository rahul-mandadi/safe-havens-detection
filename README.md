# Safe Havens Detection

 The Safe Haven Risk Detection system is a data analytics
 platform designed to assess community safety across U.S.
 counties and cities. Evaluate safety levels using socioeco
nomic indicators such as crime rates, poverty, and unemploy
ment. This system aids policymakers and organizations in
 making data-driven decisions to allocate resources effectively
 and enhance community well-being.


The platform combines data engineering, visualization, and machine learning to analyze safety levels, identify high-risk regions, and predict future risks.

## Features

1. **Database**  
   - 11-table **MySQL relational schema** normalized to 3NF.  
   - Integrated **50,000+ records** from USDA, USDC, and U.S. Census Bureau.  

2. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - **Dynamic heatmaps** for safety levels.  
   - **Bar charts** for poverty, unemployment, and crime trends.  
   - **Donut charts** visualizing crime type distributions.  

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - **Random Forest Regressor** achieves **RÂ² = 0.646** for crime prediction.  
   - Identified key predictors such as **poverty rates** and **unemployment** using **SHAP analysis**.  

4. **Administrative Tools**  
   - Add, update, and query records for **demographics**, **crime data**, and **emergency resources**.  

 
## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

2. **Go to UI Folder**
   Run the following command:
   ```bash
   streamlit run view_table.py


## Project structure
1. **AnalyticsReport** - This has all images regarding the visualizations<br>
2. **Cleaned Data** - Data after the preprocessing<br>
3. **Data** - Raw data before preprocessing<br>
4. **Extract Data** - This has the files to extract the fipscode of the counties from geocoders api.<br>
5. **Machine Learning** - This contains the machine learning models.<br>
6. **Queries** - This has connection.py file which is used to establish the connection with DB. insert_data to insert the data from excel files (used in case the data in DB is deleted or changed).<br> query.py has all query functions which are used creating the visualizations.<br>
7. **UI**- Has the UI files (developed using strealit).<br>
